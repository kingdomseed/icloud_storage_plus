Flutter plugin for iCloud document storage (iOS/macOS) with coordinated file
access and optional Files app (iCloud Drive) visibility.

Hosted reference docs are available on DeepWiki:
https://deepwiki.com/kingdomseed/icloud_storage_plus

This package operates inside your app’s iCloud ubiquity container. You choose
which container to use via the `containerId` you configured in Apple Developer
Portal / Xcode.

## Platform support

| Platform | Minimum version |
|----------|-----------------|
| iOS | 13.0 |
| macOS | 10.15 |

## Installation

```bash
flutter pub add icloud_storage_plus
```

### Swift Package Manager (optional)

This plugin supports Flutter’s Swift Package Manager integration for iOS/macOS
projects (requires Flutter `>= 3.24`). To enable SwiftPM in your app:

```bash
flutter config --enable-swift-package-manager
```

## Before you start (Xcode / entitlements)

1. Create an iCloud Container ID (example: `iCloud.com.yourapp.container`)
2. Enable iCloud for your App ID and assign that container
3. In Xcode → your target → Signing & Capabilities:
   - Add **iCloud**
   - Enable **iCloud Documents**
   - Select your container

### Files app integration (optional)

To make items visible in the Files app under “iCloud Drive”, you typically need
to declare your container under `NSUbiquitousContainers` in your `Info.plist`.

Files are only visible in Files/iCloud Drive when they live under the
`Documents/` prefix.

```dart
// Visible in Files app
cloudRelativePath: 'Documents/notes.txt'

// Not visible in Files app (still syncs)
cloudRelativePath: 'cache/notes.txt'
```

Note: your app’s folder won’t appear in Files/iCloud Drive until at least one
file exists under `Documents/`.

## Choosing the right API

There are four “tiers” of API in this plugin:

1. **Path-only transfers** for large files (no bytes returned to Dart)
   - `uploadFile` (local → iCloud)
   - `downloadFile` (iCloud → local)
2. **In-place content** for small files (bytes/strings cross the platform
   channel; loads full contents in memory)
   - `readInPlace`, `readInPlaceBytes`
   - `writeInPlace`, `writeInPlaceBytes`
   - On iOS and macOS, existing-file writes use coordinated atomic replacement so the
     destination path stays stable during overwrite.
   - On iOS and macOS, these file-write overwrite paths reject an existing directory
     destination instead of replacing it, and they only replace ubiquitous
     items that are currently up to date.
3. **File management and queries**
   - `delete`, `move`, `copy`, `rename`
   - `documentExists`, `getItemMetadata`, `getDocumentMetadata`
   - On iOS and macOS, copying onto an existing destination also uses coordinated
     atomic replacement rather than remove-then-copy behavior.
   - `copy()` keeps its file-or-directory behavior for existing destinations;
     the stricter file-only overwrite rules apply to file-write APIs such as
     `uploadFile`, `writeInPlace`, and `writeInPlaceBytes`.
4. **Container listing** (two complementary approaches)
   - `gather` — NSMetadataQuery-based; sees remote files and document promises;
     provides real-time change notifications and download progress; eventually
     consistent after local mutations
   - `listContents` — FileManager-based; immediately consistent after local
     mutations; returns download/upload status via URL resource values; only sees
     files with a local representation (including iCloud placeholders)

On iOS, when Flutter provides a background platform-channel task queue, native
filesystem work for the in-place APIs runs there so iCloud container lookup and
`UIDocument` preflight do not block the app's main thread. If that queue is not
available, Flutter falls back to its default platform-channel dispatch model.
macOS keeps the existing dispatch model.

## Quick start

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';
import 'package:icloud_storage_plus/icloud_storage.dart';

const containerId = 'iCloud.com.yourapp.container';
const notesPath = 'Documents/notes.txt';

Future<void> example() async {
  final available = await ICloudStorage.icloudAvailable();
  if (!available) {
    // Not signed into iCloud, iCloud Drive disabled, etc.
    return;
  }

  // 1) Write a text file *in place* (recommended for JSON/text).
  await ICloudStorage.writeInPlace(
    containerId: containerId,
    relativePath: notesPath,
    contents: 'Hello from iCloud',
  );

  final contents = await ICloudStorage.readInPlace(
    containerId: containerId,
    relativePath: notesPath,
  );

  // 2) Copy-out to local storage (useful for large files / sharing / etc).
  final localCopy = '${Directory.systemTemp.path}/notes.txt';
  await ICloudStorage.downloadFile(
    containerId: containerId,
    cloudRelativePath: notesPath,
    localPath: localCopy,
  );

  // 3) Typed metadata / listing.
  final metadata = await ICloudStorage.getItemMetadata(
    containerId: containerId,
    relativePath: notesPath,
  );
  if (metadata != null && !metadata.isDirectory) {
    final size = metadata.sizeInBytes;
  }

  try {
    // Example: path validation happens in Dart before calling native.
    await ICloudStorage.readInPlace(
      containerId: containerId,
      relativePath: 'Documents/.hidden.txt',
    );
  } on InvalidArgumentException catch (e) {
    // Invalid path segment (starts with '.', contains ':', etc.)
    // This is a Dart-side exception (not a PlatformException).
    throw Exception(e);
  } on ICloudOperationException catch (e) {
    // Structured request/response failures are typed in 2.0.0.
    throw Exception(e);
  } on PlatformException catch (e) {
    // Legacy unstructured native failures stay raw PlatformException values.
    throw Exception(e);
  }
}
```

## Transfers with progress

Progress is delivered via an `EventChannel` as *data events* of type
`ICloudTransferProgress`. Failures are **not** delivered via stream `onError`.
In `2.0.0`, transfer-progress failures still carry raw `PlatformException`
objects in `event.exception` even though structured request/response APIs now
map to typed Dart exceptions.

Important: the progress stream is listener-driven; start listening immediately
in the `onProgress` callback or you may miss early events.

```dart
await ICloudStorage.uploadFile(
  containerId: containerId,
  localPath: '/absolute/path/to/local/file.pdf',
  cloudRelativePath: 'Documents/file.pdf',
  onProgress: (stream) {
    stream.listen((event) {
      if (event.isProgress) {
        // 0.0 - 100.0
        final percent = event.percent!;
      } else if (event.isError) {
        final exception = event.exception!;
      }
    });
  },
);
```

## Paths: `cloudRelativePath` vs `relativePath`

This plugin always works in terms of paths *inside* the iCloud container:

- `cloudRelativePath`: used by `uploadFile` / `downloadFile`
- `relativePath`: used by the rest of the API

These are the same kind of value; the naming difference exists for historical
reasons.

### Trailing slashes

Directory paths can show up with trailing slashes in metadata, so the
directory-oriented methods accept them:

- `delete`, `move`, `copy`, `rename`, `documentExists`, `getItemMetadata`,
  `getDocumentMetadata`

File-centric operations reject trailing slashes (they require a file path):

- `uploadFile`, `downloadFile`
- `readInPlace`, `readInPlaceBytes`, `writeInPlace`, `writeInPlaceBytes`

On iOS and macOS, file-centric overwrite operations also reject an existing directory
destination instead of replacing it. If you need to replace an existing
directory tree, use the directory-aware `copy()` APIs rather than a file-write
operation.

### Path validation

Many methods validate path segments in Dart and throw `InvalidArgumentException`
for invalid values (empty segments, segments starting with `.`, segments that
contain `:` or `/`, etc).

## Listing / watching with `gather`

`gather()` returns a `GatherResult`:

- `files`: parsed metadata entries
- `invalidEntries`: entries that could not be parsed into `ICloudFile`

When `onUpdate` is provided, the update stream stays active until the
subscription is canceled. (Dispose listeners when done.)

```dart
final initial = await ICloudStorage.gather(
  containerId: containerId,
  onUpdate: (stream) {
    stream.listen((update) {
      // Full file list on every update.
      final files = update.files;
    });
  },
);
```

## Immediate listing with `listContents`

`listContents()` returns `List<ContainerItem>` — an immediately-consistent
snapshot of the container (or a subdirectory) using `FileManager` rather than
`NSMetadataQuery`.

```dart
final items = await ICloudStorage.listContents(
  containerId: containerId,
  relativePath: 'Documents/', // optional; defaults to container root
);

for (final item in items) {
  print('${item.relativePath} — ${item.downloadStatus}');
  if (item.isDirectory) print('  (directory)');
  if (item.hasUnresolvedConflicts) print('  ⚠ conflicts');
}
```

### `gather` vs `listContents`

| Capability | `gather` | `listContents` |
|---|---|---|
| Consistency after mutations | Eventually consistent (Spotlight index lag) | **Immediately consistent** |
| Sees remote-only files | Yes (document promises) | No |
| Real-time change notifications | Yes (via `onUpdate` stream) | No (one-shot) |
| Download/upload progress % | Yes | No |
| Download/upload status | Yes | Yes |
| Conflict detection | Yes | Yes |
| Hidden files (`.DS_Store`, etc.) | Excluded by Spotlight | Filtered by resolved-name prefix |
| Underlying mechanism | `NSMetadataQuery` (Spotlight) | `FileManager` + URL resource values |

**When to use which:**

- **After your own mutations** (rename, delete, copy, write): use `listContents`
  for an immediate, accurate listing.
- **Initial sync on a new device**: use `gather` to discover document promises
  (remote files not yet represented locally).
- **Live monitoring**: use `gather` with `onUpdate` for real-time change
  notifications from other devices.

## iCloud placeholder files

iCloud uses placeholder files to represent items that exist in iCloud but have
not been fully downloaded to the local device. There are two eras:

- **iOS and pre-Sonoma macOS**: stub files named `.originalName.icloud` (~192
  bytes) that stand in for the real file.
- **macOS Sonoma+**: APFS dataless files that keep the real filename and logical
  size; the actual content is fetched on demand.

Both `gather` and `listContents` handle this transparently — they resolve
placeholder names and report download status so you don't need to parse
`.icloud` filenames yourself.

`listContents` also filters out system hidden files (`.DS_Store`, `.Trash`,
`.DocumentRevisions-V100`, etc.) by skipping any entry whose resolved name
starts with `.`. Files whose real name starts with `.` will not appear in
`listContents` results. `gather` excludes most of these naturally via
Spotlight's indexing scope.

To check if a file has local content available:

```dart
// With ContainerItem (from listContents)
if (item.isDownloaded) {
  // File has local content (downloadStatus is .downloaded or .current)
}

// With ICloudFile (from gather)
if (file.downloadStatus == DownloadStatus.current) {
  // Fully up-to-date local copy
}
```

## Metadata models

### `ICloudItemMetadata` (from `getItemMetadata`)

Populated from the known-path metadata request API. This is the typed metadata
model for request/response use.

```dart
class ICloudItemMetadata {
  final String relativePath;
  final bool isDirectory;

  final int? sizeInBytes;
  final DateTime? creationDate;
  final DateTime? contentChangeDate;

  final bool isDownloading;
  final DownloadStatus? downloadStatus;
  final bool isUploading;
  final bool isUploaded;
  final bool hasUnresolvedConflicts;

  /// Whether the item has local content available.
  bool get isLocal => ...;
}
```

### `ICloudFile` (from `gather`)

Populated from `NSMetadataQuery`. Eventually consistent — the Spotlight index
may lag behind local filesystem mutations.

```dart
class ICloudFile {
  final String relativePath;
  final bool isDirectory;

  final int? sizeInBytes;
  final DateTime? creationDate;
  final DateTime? contentChangeDate;

  final bool isDownloading;
  final DownloadStatus? downloadStatus;
  final bool isUploading;
  final bool isUploaded;
  final bool hasUnresolvedConflicts;
}
```

### `ContainerItem` (from `listContents`)

Populated from `FileManager.contentsOfDirectory` with URL resource values.
Immediately consistent after local mutations.

```dart
class ContainerItem {
  final String relativePath;
  final bool isDirectory;

  final DownloadStatus? downloadStatus;
  final bool isDownloading;
  final bool isUploaded;
  final bool isUploading;
  final bool hasUnresolvedConflicts;

  /// Whether the item has local content available.
  bool get isDownloaded => ...;
}
```

`ContainerItem` does not include `sizeInBytes`, `creationDate`, or
`contentChangeDate` — these require `NSMetadataQuery` or additional URL resource
key lookups that are not part of the current implementation.

## Error handling

### Dart-side validation (`InvalidArgumentException`)

Thrown when you pass an invalid path/name to the Dart API (before calling
native code).

### Structured request/response failures (`ICloudOperationException`)

Structured native failures from request/response APIs such as `readInPlace`,
`writeInPlace`, `copy`, `getContainerPath`, and `getItemMetadata` map to typed
exceptions in `2.0.0`:

- `ICloudContainerAccessException`
- `ICloudItemNotFoundException`
- `ICloudConflictException`
- `ICloudCoordinationException`
- `ICloudItemNotDownloadedException`
- `ICloudDownloadInProgressException`
- `ICloudTimeoutException`
- `ICloudUnknownNativeException`

For iOS and macOS file-write overwrite operations, trying to overwrite an existing
directory target is treated as an invalid argument rather than as a successful
replacement.

These exceptions expose `operation`, `retryable`, `relativePath`, and native
error context when the platform provides it.

`ICloudCoordinationException` is reserved for structured coordination failures.
Current iOS and macOS native implementations still classify some lower-level
coordination problems as `ICloudUnknownNativeException` when they do not yet
emit an explicit `coordination` category.

### Raw `PlatformException` cases

`PlatformException` is still the contract for:

- legacy unstructured request/response failures
- `getDocumentMetadata()`
- transfer-progress stream error events (`event.exception`)

`PlatformExceptionCode` contains constants:

- `E_CTR` (iCloud container/permission issues)
- `E_CONFLICT` (structured conflict failures)
- `E_FNF` (file not found)
- `E_NOT_DOWNLOADED` (structured nonlocal placeholder failures)
- `E_DOWNLOAD_IN_PROGRESS` (structured active-download failures)
- `E_FNF_READ` (file not found during read)
- `E_FNF_WRITE` (file not found during write)
- `E_NAT` (native error)
- `E_ARG` (invalid arguments passed to native)
- `E_READ` (read failure)
- `E_CANCEL` (operation canceled)
- `E_INIT` (plugin not properly initialized)
- `E_TIMEOUT` (download idle timeout)
- `E_PLUGIN_INTERNAL` (internal plugin error)
- `E_INVALID_EVENT` (invalid event from native layer)

## Troubleshooting / gotchas

- Prefer testing on physical devices. iCloud sync is unreliable in iOS
  Simulator.
- `documentExists()` checks the filesystem path in the container; it does not
  force a download.
- If Files app visibility matters, ensure paths start with `Documents/` and
  your container is configured under `NSUbiquitousContainers`.
- After a rename/move/delete, `gather()` may still return stale results for a
  few seconds while the Spotlight index catches up. Use `listContents()` for
  immediate consistency.
