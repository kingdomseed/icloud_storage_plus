# iCloud Storage Plus Project Brief

## Project Overview
iCloud Storage Plus is a Flutter plugin that provides a comprehensive interface for interacting with Apple's iCloud storage system. It enables Flutter applications to seamlessly integrate with iCloud for file storage, synchronization, and management across iOS and macOS platforms.

## Core Requirements

1. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - iOS and macOS support for iCloud integration
   - Consistent API across platforms

2. **File Operations**
   - Upload files to iCloud
   - Download files from iCloud
   - Delete files from iCloud
   - Move/rename files within iCloud
   - List files stored in iCloud

3. **Progress Monitoring**
   - Track upload progress
   - Track download progress

4. **Error Handling**
   - Robust error handling for all operations
   - Clear error messages for debugging

5. **iCloud Integration**
   - Proper implementation of iCloud file coordination
   - Support for iCloud container management
   - Handling of iCloud availability and user authentication

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving the iCloud file coordination implementation to better align with Apple's best practices. This includes:

1. Adding proper NSFileCoordinator usage to all file operations
2. Implementing UIDocument/NSDocument for better iCloud integration
3. Enhancing error handling and conflict resolution
4. Ensuring backward compatibility with existing API

## Success Criteria

1. All file operations properly use NSFileCoordinator to prevent conflicts
2. Document-based operations are available for advanced use cases
3. Existing API continues to function without breaking changes
4. Plugin performs reliably in real-world iCloud environments
5. Code is well-documented and follows best practices
