# iCloud Storage Plus Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving the iCloud file coordination implementation to better align with Apple's best practices. We have successfully implemented Phase 1 of the file coordination improvements plan, which involved adding NSFileCoordinator to the upload method. We've also implemented NSFileCoordinator for download operations ahead of schedule. Now we're preparing to move on to Phase 2.

### Completed Tasks

**Phase 1: Add NSFileCoordinator to Upload Method**

This phase has been completed. We've successfully implemented NSFileCoordinator for the upload method in both iOS and macOS, providing immediate benefits for file coordination while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Additional Improvement: NSFileCoordinator for Download Operations**

We've also implemented NSFileCoordinator for download operations in both iOS and macOS implementations, which was originally planned for Phase 3. This provides better file coordination for all file operations.

### Next Priority Task

**Phase 2: Create Document Wrapper Classes**

The next phase involves creating UIDocument/NSDocument wrapper classes for better iCloud integration, which will provide improved conflict resolution and version tracking.

## Recent Changes

1. **Implementation of File Coordination**
   - Added NSFileCoordinator to the upload method in iOS implementation (SwiftIcloudStoragePlugin.swift)
   - Added NSFileCoordinator to the upload method in macOS implementation (IcloudStoragePlugin.swift)
   - Added NSFileCoordinator to the download method in iOS implementation
   - Added NSFileCoordinator to the download method in macOS implementation
   - Implemented proper error handling for coordination errors
   - Maintained existing progress monitoring functionality

2. **Documentation Update**
   - Created comprehensive implementation plan for file coordination improvements
   - Documented the implementation details for all phases
   - Updated progress tracking to reflect completed Phase 1

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2)

1. **Create Document Wrapper Classes**
   - Implement `ICloudDocument` class for iOS (UIDocument)
   - Implement `ICloudDocument` class for macOS (NSDocument)
   - Add helper methods for document operations

2. **Testing**
   - Test document operations with various file types
   - Verify proper handling of conflicts
   - Test integration with existing functionality

### Future Phases

3. **Phase 2: Create Document Wrapper Classes**
   - Implement `ICloudDocument` class for iOS (UIDocument)
   - Implement `ICloudDocument` class for macOS (NSDocument)
   - Add helper methods for document operations

4. **Phase 3: Modify Platform Channel Methods**
   - Improve error handling and progress reporting
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources

5. **Phase 4: Add Document-Based File Operations**
   - Implement new methods for document reading/writing
   - Ensure backward compatibility

6. **Phase 5: Update Flutter Platform Interface**
   - Add new methods to platform interface
   - Implement method channel handlers
   - Update public API

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Implementation Approach

1. **Incremental vs. Complete Rewrite**
   - **Decision**: Taking an incremental approach by implementing improvements in phases
   - **Rationale**: Minimizes risk of breaking existing functionality while still improving the implementation
   - **Consideration**: Each phase should be independently testable and deployable

2. **File Coordination Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Use NSFileCoordinator for all file operations that modify iCloud content
   - **Rationale**: Follows Apple's best practices and prevents data corruption
   - **Consideration**: Need to ensure proper error handling for coordination failures

3. **Document-Based Approach**
   - **Decision**: Plan to implement UIDocument/NSDocument in future phases
   - **Rationale**: Provides better conflict resolution and version tracking
   - **Consideration**: Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### Technical Challenges

1. **Error Handling**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring comprehensive error handling for coordination errors
   - **Approach**: Wrap all native errors in appropriate Flutter errors with clear messages
   - **Consideration**: Need to test various error scenarios

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining progress monitoring functionality with new implementation
   - **Approach**: Ensure event channels are properly set up and cleaned up
   - **Consideration**: Test with various file sizes and network conditions

3. **Background Operation**
   - **Challenge**: Handling app suspension during file operations
   - **Approach**: Ensure operations are properly coordinated and can resume
   - **Consideration**: Test app lifecycle scenarios

### API Evolution

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Decision**: Maintain existing API while adding new capabilities
   - **Rationale**: Prevents breaking changes for existing users
   - **Consideration**: Document migration path for users who want to adopt new features

2. **New API Methods**
   - **Decision**: Plan to add document-based methods in future phases
   - **Rationale**: Provides more advanced capabilities for users who need them
   - **Consideration**: Ensure new methods follow consistent naming and parameter patterns

## Current Status

- Documentation of implementation plan is complete
- Phase 1 implementation is ready to begin
- Testing strategy has been defined
- Timeline for all phases has been estimated (9-14 days total)
