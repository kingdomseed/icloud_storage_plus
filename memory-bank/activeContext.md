# iCloud Storage Plus Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on improving the iCloud file coordination implementation to better align with Apple's best practices. Specifically, we are working on implementing Phase 1 of the file coordination improvements plan, which involves adding NSFileCoordinator to the upload method.

### Priority Task

**Phase 1: Add NSFileCoordinator to Upload Method**

This phase has been identified as the easiest to implement with minimal risk of breaking existing functionality. It provides immediate benefits for file coordination while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Recent Changes

1. **Documentation Update**
   - Created comprehensive implementation plan for file coordination improvements
   - Identified Phase 1 (NSFileCoordinator for upload) as the priority task
   - Documented the implementation details for all phases

2. **Analysis**
   - Reviewed current implementation and identified gaps in file coordination
   - Analyzed Apple's best practices for iCloud integration
   - Evaluated the risks and benefits of different implementation approaches

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1)

1. **Implement NSFileCoordinator in Upload Method**
   - Modify `upload` method in `SwiftIcloudStoragePlugin.swift` (iOS)
   - Make corresponding changes in `IcloudStoragePlugin.swift` (macOS)
   - Ensure proper error handling for coordination errors

2. **Testing**
   - Test upload functionality with various file sizes
   - Verify that progress monitoring still works correctly
   - Test edge cases (network interruptions, app suspension)

### Future Phases

3. **Phase 2: Create Document Wrapper Classes**
   - Implement `ICloudDocument` class for iOS (UIDocument)
   - Implement `ICloudDocument` class for macOS (NSDocument)
   - Add helper methods for document operations

4. **Phase 3: Modify Platform Channel Methods**
   - Enhance download method with proper file coordination
   - Improve error handling and progress reporting

5. **Phase 4: Add Document-Based File Operations**
   - Implement new methods for document reading/writing
   - Ensure backward compatibility

6. **Phase 5: Update Flutter Platform Interface**
   - Add new methods to platform interface
   - Implement method channel handlers
   - Update public API

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Implementation Approach

1. **Incremental vs. Complete Rewrite**
   - **Decision**: Taking an incremental approach by implementing improvements in phases
   - **Rationale**: Minimizes risk of breaking existing functionality while still improving the implementation
   - **Consideration**: Each phase should be independently testable and deployable

2. **File Coordination Strategy**
   - **Decision**: Use NSFileCoordinator for all file operations that modify iCloud content
   - **Rationale**: Follows Apple's best practices and prevents data corruption
   - **Consideration**: Need to ensure proper error handling for coordination failures

3. **Document-Based Approach**
   - **Decision**: Plan to implement UIDocument/NSDocument in future phases
   - **Rationale**: Provides better conflict resolution and version tracking
   - **Consideration**: Need to maintain backward compatibility with existing API

### Technical Challenges

1. **Error Handling**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring comprehensive error handling for coordination errors
   - **Approach**: Wrap all native errors in appropriate Flutter errors with clear messages
   - **Consideration**: Need to test various error scenarios

2. **Progress Monitoring**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining progress monitoring functionality with new implementation
   - **Approach**: Ensure event channels are properly set up and cleaned up
   - **Consideration**: Test with various file sizes and network conditions

3. **Background Operation**
   - **Challenge**: Handling app suspension during file operations
   - **Approach**: Ensure operations are properly coordinated and can resume
   - **Consideration**: Test app lifecycle scenarios

### API Evolution

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - **Decision**: Maintain existing API while adding new capabilities
   - **Rationale**: Prevents breaking changes for existing users
   - **Consideration**: Document migration path for users who want to adopt new features

2. **New API Methods**
   - **Decision**: Plan to add document-based methods in future phases
   - **Rationale**: Provides more advanced capabilities for users who need them
   - **Consideration**: Ensure new methods follow consistent naming and parameter patterns

## Current Status

- Documentation of implementation plan is complete
- Phase 1 implementation is ready to begin
- Testing strategy has been defined
- Timeline for all phases has been estimated (9-14 days total)
