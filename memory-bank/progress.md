# iCloud Storage Plus Progress

## What Works

### Core Functionality

1. **iCloud Availability Check**
   - ✅ Checking if iCloud is available and user is logged in
   - ✅ Proper error handling for unavailable iCloud

2. **File Operations**
   - ✅ Listing files in iCloud container
   - ✅ Uploading files to iCloud
   - ✅ Downloading files from iCloud
   - ✅ Deleting files from iCloud
   - ✅ Moving files within iCloud
   - ✅ Renaming files in iCloud

3. **Progress Monitoring**
   - ✅ Upload progress tracking
   - ✅ Download progress tracking
   - ✅ Event channel implementation for real-time updates

4. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ Basic error handling for all operations
   - ✅ Standardized error codes and messages

5. **Platform Support**
   - ✅ iOS implementation
   - ✅ macOS implementation

### File Coordination

1. **NSFileCoordinator Usage**
   - ✅ Used in delete operations
   - ✅ Used in move operations
   - ✅ Used in upload operations (Phase 1 completed)
   - ✅ Used in download operations (implemented ahead of schedule)

2. **Document-Based Approach**
   - ❌ UIDocument/NSDocument not yet implemented (future phase)
   - ❌ Document-based file operations not yet available (future phase)

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Add NSFileCoordinator to Upload Method ✅

- [x] Implement NSFileCoordinator in iOS upload method
- [x] Implement NSFileCoordinator in macOS upload method
- [x] Add proper error handling for coordination errors
- [ ] Test implementation with various file sizes and conditions

### Future Phases

1. **Phase 2: Create Document Wrapper Classes**
   - [ ] Create UIDocument subclass for iOS
   - [ ] Create NSDocument subclass for macOS
   - [ ] Implement document reading/writing methods

2. **Phase 3: Modify Platform Channel Methods**
   - [ ] Enhance download method with NSFileCoordinator
   - [ ] Improve error handling in all methods
   - [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of resources

3. **Phase 4: Add Document-Based File Operations**
   - [ ] Implement readDocument method
   - [ ] Implement writeDocument method
   - [ ] Add proper error handling

4. **Phase 5: Update Flutter Platform Interface**
   - [ ] Add new methods to platform interface
   - [ ] Implement method channel handlers
   - [ ] Update public API documentation

## Known Issues

### Current Implementation

1. **File Coordination**
   - **Issue**: ✅ Resolved - All file operations now use NSFileCoordinator
   - **Impact**: Improved data integrity and prevention of conflicts
   - **Status**: Completed ahead of schedule

2. **Conflict Resolution**
   - **Issue**: Limited conflict resolution capabilities
   - **Impact**: Conflicts may not be handled optimally
   - **Status**: To be improved with document-based approach in future phases

3. **Background Processing**
   - **Issue**: Limited handling of app suspension during file operations
   - **Impact**: Operations may fail if app is suspended
   - **Status**: To be improved in future phases

### Edge Cases

1. **Large Files**
   - **Issue**: Performance degradation with very large files
   - **Impact**: Slow uploads/downloads, potential timeouts
   - **Status**: Known limitation, recommend chunking large files

2. **Network Interruptions**
   - **Issue**: Limited recovery from network interruptions
   - **Impact**: Operations may fail if network is unstable
   - **Status**: iCloud handles some recovery, but can be improved

3. **iCloud Storage Limits**
   - **Issue**: No handling of iCloud storage quota limits
   - **Impact**: Operations may fail if user is out of storage
   - **Status**: Better error messages needed for quota issues

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests

- ✅ API method signatures and parameter validation
- ✅ Platform interface implementation
- ❌ Native code integration (limited by Flutter test framework)

### Integration Tests

- ✅ Basic file operations in example app
- ⚠️ Limited testing of error conditions
- ❌ No automated testing of background processing

### Manual Testing

- ✅ All operations tested on iOS devices
- ✅ All operations tested on macOS
- ⚠️ Limited testing of edge cases and error conditions

## Next Milestone

**Phase 2 Implementation: Create Document Wrapper Classes**

Expected completion: 2-3 days

Success criteria:
- UIDocument subclass implemented for iOS
- NSDocument subclass implemented for macOS
- Helper methods for document operations created
- Foundation laid for document-based file operations
